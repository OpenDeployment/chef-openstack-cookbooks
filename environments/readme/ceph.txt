To setup a ceph cluster with 3 mons 7 osds 1 radosgw:
1 Change config in the environment
   a. set a fsid to the cluster using uuidgen command
   b. change the "public network","cluster network" in environment
   c. change the "osd pool default pg num" "osd pool default pgp num", the cluster has a better peformance when it's set to (osd number)*100
   d. change the "osd journal size", the number is measured in MB, you can set it simply to 10000. but is should be smaller than the disk capacity

2 Set the server run list
   server1: "role[ceph-mon],role[ceph-osd],ceph[ceph-radosgw]"
   server1: "role[ceph-mon],role[ceph-osd]"
   server1: "role[ceph-mon],role[ceph-osd]"
   server1: "role[ceph-osd]"
   server1: "role[ceph-osd]"
   server1: "role[ceph-osd]"
   server1: "role[ceph-osd]"

3 Run chef-client on each server
